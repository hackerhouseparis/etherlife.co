      Etherlife.co is a decentralized application running blockchain protocol to create legacy contracts.
      <br />
      To use it, add Ether or a smart contract and set up the duration of ping.
      If you do not ping on this duration, the rights of your contract are given
      of the first benificiary, and so on.

      That's all ! :)
